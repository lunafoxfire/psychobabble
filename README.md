# Psychobabble

Psychobabble is a technology-assisted service offered to employers to help enhance their application process, particularly when it comes to soft-skill assessment. Currently, the most common way for an employer to grade the soft-skills of potential applicants is through multiple choice personality questionaires, which have many flaws. Soft-skills are more accurately determined through conversational, open-ended methods that allow an applicant to build their own answer to a question rather than choose from a predetermined list. Psychobabble provides a platform for applicants to record verbal answers to video-format questions during an online application. These answers are then analyzed by experts and graded based on how well they match the particular soft-skill traits that an employer is looking for.
