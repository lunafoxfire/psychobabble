    <h2>Replace traditional "tests" and increase fairness</h2>
    <p>
      There is a not-so-subtle problem with multiple-choice cognitive ability tests and aptitude tests: these tests reduce job
      opportunities for minority groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Psychobabble aims to eliminate the bias and reach all Top Talent equally, reguardless of where it comes from.
